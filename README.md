# Age Of Namesâ„¢

## This is a test for an internship at NAUMEN.

The app consists of a backend (Java) and frontend (Angular) projects. Since it's not going to be deployed, the connection is localhost and it's not adapted for deployment.

Main idea of the project is to make a service that tracks names and their ages consistently. 
The main requirements were to implement:
- Upload files with a special format of 'Name_AGE' and parse it;
- Searching through a form with adding new entries if they were not found;
- Statistics of requests by name;
- Searching for the eldest person (I've gone further and made a scalable filtering system)

### Backend 
Backend is written in Java with a CSD architecture. It uses Spring Boot. Build is done via Maven.

### Frontend
Frontend is written using the Angular framework.
